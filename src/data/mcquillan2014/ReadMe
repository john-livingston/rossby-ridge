Abstract:
    We analyzed three years of data from the Kepler space mission to
    derive rotation periods of main-sequence stars below 6500K. Our
    automated autocorrelation-based method detected rotation periods
    between 0.2 and 70 days for 34030 (25.6%) of the 133030 main-sequence
    Kepler targets (excluding known eclipsing binaries and Kepler Objects
    of Interest), making this the largest sample of stellar rotation
    periods to date. In this paper we consider the detailed features of
    the now well-populated period-temperature distribution and demonstrate
    that the period bimodality, first seen by McQuillan et al.
    (2013MNRAS.432.1203M) in the M-dwarf sample, persists to higher
    masses, becoming less visible above 0.6M_{sun}_. We show that these
    results are globally consistent with the existing ground-based
    rotation-period data and find that the upper envelope of the period
    distribution is broadly consistent with a gyrochronological age of
    4.5Gyr, based on the isochrones of Barnes (2007ApJ...669.1167B),
    Mamajek, & Hillenbrand (Cat. J/ApJ/687/1264) and Meibom et al.
    (Cat. J/ApJ/695/679). We also performed a detailed comparison of our
    results to those of Reinhold et al. (Cat. J/A+A/560/A4) and Nielsen et
    al. (Cat. J/A+A/557/L10), who measured rotation periods of field stars
    observed by Kepler. We examined the amplitude of periodic variability
    for the stars with detection rotation periods, and found a typical
    range between ~950 ppm (5th percentile) and ~22700ppm (95th
    percentile), with a median of ~5600ppm. We found typically higher
    amplitudes for shorter periods and lower effective temperatures, with
    an excess of low-amplitude stars above ~5400K.

Description:
    This analysis made use of the public releases 14-19 of quarter 3-14
    (Q3-Q14; Sept 2009-Jun 2012) light curves, which were downloaded from
    the Kepler mission archive.

Note (2): In table 2, targets without a w value were rejected at selection
          process stage 1 because the period detection did not occur in enough
          segments (see Appendix A for details). In these cases, Prot, e_Prot,
          LPH and w are left blank.

   0 = T_eff_ and log(g) are from the KIC (Cat. V/133).
